# MaRaca

There is a design dissonance between the programming language that was used for the 'first version' of Cajonic 
  (at least, the way it is left on user ComradeDracose's (which is me, for the record) repository).

Re-factoring to Rust CAN (because it compiles to machine code) be faster than C#.

This is a fork to refactor Cajonic to Rust.
As of writing this, I do not know how to code in Rust.
