# CCajonic

There is a design dissonance between the programming language that was used for the 'first version' of Cajonic 
  (at least, the way it is left on user ComradeDracose's (which is me, for the record) repository.

Cajonic wants efficiency and simplicity. C# is by far not the fastest language, so the efforts to optimise the code
  (by making a lot of code run in parallel) are moot.

This is a fork to refactor Cajonic to Rust.
As of writing this, I do not know how to code in Rust.
