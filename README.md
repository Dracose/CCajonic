# MaraCa

There is a design dissonance between the programming language that was used for the 'first version' of Cajonic 
  (at least, the way it is left on user ComradeDracose's (which is me, for the record) repository).

Re-factoring to C CAN be faster than C#.

This is a fork to refactor Cajonic to C, using the GTK UI-Framework.
As of writing this, I do not know how to code in C. However, learning a new language might infuse some new life into this project.
